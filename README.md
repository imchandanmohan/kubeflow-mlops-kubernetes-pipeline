# 🏥 kubeflow-mlops-kubernetes-pipeline

An end-to-end MLOps project for predicting colorectal cancer patient survival using machine learning, with comprehensive experiment tracking, pipeline orchestration, and deployment automation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline for colorectal cancer survival prediction, showcasing modern MLOps practices including experiment tracking with MLflow, containerization with Docker, and orchestration using Kubeflow on a local Kubernetes cluster.

## ✨ Key Features

- **MLflow Integration with DagsHub**: Complete experiment tracking and model versioning
- **Local Kubernetes Cluster**: Production-grade infrastructure on your local machine
- **Kubeflow Pipelines**: Automated ML workflow orchestration
- **Docker Containerization**: Consistent deployment across environments
- **Data Versioning**: Track datasets and code changes throughout the project lifecycle
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data processing to model deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses colorectal cancer patient data to predict survival outcomes. The dataset includes various clinical and pathological features that influence patient prognosis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker Desktop
- Kubernetes (Minikube or Docker Desktop with K8s enabled)
- kubectl CLI
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imchandanmohan/Colorectal-Cancer-Survival-Prediction.git
cd Colorectal-Cancer-Survival-Prediction
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure MLflow with DagsHub
```bash
# Set environment variables
